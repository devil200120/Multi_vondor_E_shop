# Related Products Navigation Fix

## Issue Description
When users clicked on related products in the ProductDetailsPage, they were not navigating properly to the new product. The page would not update with the new product data.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the ProductDetailsPage component's `useEffect` hook. The effect was missing the `id` parameter in its dependency array, which meant:

1. When users clicked on a related product, the URL changed (e.g., from `/product/123` to `/product/456`)
2. However, the `useEffect` didn't re-run because `id` wasn't in the dependencies
3. As a result, the component didn't fetch the new product data
4. The page appeared unresponsive to related product clicks

## Solution Implemented

### Before Fix:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    if (eventData !== null) {
        const data = allEvents && allEvents.find((i) => i._id === id);
        setData(data);
    } else {
        const data = allProducts && allProducts.find((i) => i._id === id);
        setData(data);
    }
    window.scrollTo(0, 0)
}, [allProducts, allEvents]); // Missing id and eventData dependencies
```

### After Fix:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    if (eventData !== null) {
        const data = allEvents && allEvents.find((i) => i._id === id);
        setData(data);
    } else {
        const data = allProducts && allProducts.find((i) => i._id === id);
        setData(data);
    }
    window.scrollTo(0, 0)
}, [allProducts, allEvents, id, eventData]); // Added missing dependencies
```

## Changes Made

1. **Added `id` to dependency array**: Now the effect re-runs when the URL parameter changes
2. **Added `eventData` to dependency array**: Ensures effect runs when switching between products and events
3. **Maintained scroll behavior**: Page still scrolls to top on navigation

## Result

✅ **Fixed Navigation**: Related products now work correctly
✅ **Proper State Updates**: Product data updates when clicking related products
✅ **Scroll Behavior**: Page scrolls to top on each navigation
✅ **Event Support**: Works for both regular products and events

## User Experience Impact

- Users can now seamlessly browse through related products
- Each click loads the new product data correctly
- Page scrolls to top for better viewing experience
- Maintains all existing functionality while fixing the navigation issue

## Technical Details

**File Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/ProductDetailsPage.jsx`
**Component**: ProductDetailsPage
**Hook**: useEffect dependency array
**Dependencies Added**: `id`, `eventData`

This fix ensures that the React useEffect hook properly responds to URL parameter changes, allowing for smooth navigation between related products in the e-commerce platform.
